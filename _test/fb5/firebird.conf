# Firebird version 5.0 configuration file
#
#########################################

# Comments
# --------
# The # character is used for comments and can be placed anywhere on a
# line. Anything following the # character on a line is considered a
# comment.
#
# Examples:
#
#    # This is a comment
#    DefaultDbCachePages = 2048   # This is an end-of-line comment
#
# Entries
# -------
# The default value for each entry is listed to the right of the "=".
# To activate an entry, remove the leading "#"s and supply the desired
# value.
#
# By default, a number of the values are specified in **Bytes** (Not KB).
# You may add obvious abbreviations k, m and g in the end of a number to specify
# kilobytes, megabytes and gigabytes.
#
# There are three types of configuration values: integer, boolean and string.
#
# Integer
# -------
# Integers is what they sound like, an integral value. Examples:
#   1
#   42
#   4711
#   24M		# 24 * 1024 * 1024
#
# Boolean
# -------
# Boolean is expressed as integer values with 0 (zero) being "false" and
# non-zero is taken to mean "true". For consistency we recommend you
# only use 0/1. Also strings 'y', 'yes' and 'true' stand for "true".
#
# String
# ------
# Strings are also what they sound like, strings. Example:
#   RemoteServiceName = gds_db
#
# Scopes
# ------
# Some parameters are marked as per-database / per-connection configurable.
# Per-database configuration is done in file databases.conf (former aliases.conf).
# Per-connection configuration is primarily client tool and done using
# isc_dpb_config parameter in DPB (isc_spb_config for services).
# Configuration data, added to parameters block, has the same format as this file.
# Pay attention that since Firebird 3.0 there is no hard limit of 255 bytes per entry
# provided you are using isc_dpb_version2 format of DPB. The simplest way to create
# DPB/SPB is to use IXpbBuilder - when needed you will have >255 bytes entries in
# parameters block. Notice that per-database entries also may be tuned using DPB
# in case of embedded engine when attaching to database first time.
#
# Macro substitution
# ------------------
# There is a number of predefined macro commands, that can be used in config
# files where directory name is needed. They are available using $(name) syntax.
# The complete list of them as follows:
#	root - root directory of Firebird instance
#	install - directory where Firebird is installed
#	this - directory where current configuration file is located
#	dir_conf - directory where firebird.conf and databases.conf are located
#	dir_secDb - directory where default security database is located
#	dir_plugins - directory where plugins are located
#	dir_udf - directory where UDFs are located by default
#	dir_sample - directory where samples are located
#	dir_sampleDb - directory where sample DB (employee.fdb) is located
#	dir_intl - directory where international modules are located
#	dir_msg - directory where messages file (firebird.msg) is located
# Like the rest of config internals, macros are case-insensitive.
# Capital letters here are used only for better human readability.
#
# Includes
# --------
# One can include one config file into another one.
# When relative path is used, it's treated relative to current config file.
# I.e. when
#	include some_file.conf
# is used in /opt/config/master.conf, we include /opt/config/some_file.conf.
# Traditional wildcards * and ? may be used in include operator. In this case
# all matching files will be included in undefined order. Example:
#	include $(dir_plugins)/config/*.conf
#
# Portions of this file have been reproduced/made available with the
# permission of Ann Harrison @ IBPhoenix.


# ----------------------------
# Database Paths/Directories
#
# DatabaseAccess may be None, Full or Restrict. If you choose Restrict,
# provide ';'-separated trees list, where database files are stored.
# Relative paths are treated relative to the root directory of Firebird.
# Default value 'Full' gives full access to all files on your system.
# To specify access to specific trees, enumerate all required paths
# (for Windows this may be something like 'C:\DataBase;D:\Mirror',
# for unix - '/db;/mnt/mirrordb'). If you choose 'None', then only
# databases listed in databases.conf can be attached using alias.
#
# Note: simple quotation marks shown above should *NOT* be used when
# specifying values and directory path names. Examples:
#
# DatabaseAccess = None
# DatabaseAccess = Restrict C:\DataBase
# DatabaseAccess = Restrict C:\DataBase;D:\Mirror
# DatabaseAccess = Restrict /db
# DatabaseAccess = Restrict /db;/mnt/mirrordb
# DatabaseAccess = Full
#
# UNCONTROLLED DATABASE ACCESS MAY COMPROMISE YOUR SYSTEM!
# IT IS STRONGLY RECOMMENDED THAT THIS SETTING BE USED TO LIMIT
# DATABASE LOCATIONS!
#
# Type: string (special format)
#
#DatabaseAccess = Full


# ----------------------------
# Ability to access databases remotely
#
# RemoteAccess may be true or false (1/0, Yes/No) - it's a boolean value.
# By default RemoteAccess to all databases except security DB is enabled.
# If you plan to use more than one dedicated security database, it's
# recommended to disable remote access to them in databases.conf.
# However, as an additional method to have secure enhanced Firebird
# installation, one can disable remote access globally and re-enable
# in databases.conf only for specific databases.
#
# Per-database configurable.
#
# Type: boolean
#
#RemoteAccess = true


# ----------------------------
# External File Paths/Directories
#
# ExternalFileAccess may be None, Full or Restrict. If you choose
# Restrict, provide ';'-separated trees list, where external files
# are stored. Relative paths are treated relative to the root directory
# of Firebird. Default value 'None' disables any use of external files
# on your site. To specify access to specific trees, enum all required
# paths (for Windows this may be something like 'C:\ExternalTables',
# for unix - '/db/extern;/mnt/extern').
#
# Per-database configurable.
#
# NOTE: THE EXTERNAL TABLE ENGINE FEATURE COULD BE USED TO COMPROMISE
# THE SERVER/HOST AS WELL AS DATABASE SECURITY!
#
# IT IS STRONGLY RECOMMENDED THAT THIS SETTING BE USED TO LIMIT
# EXTERNAL TABLE LOCATIONS!
#
# Type: string (special format)
#
#ExternalFileAccess = None


# ----------------------------
# External Function (UDF) Paths/Directories
#
# UdfAccess may be None, Full or Restrict. If you choose
# Restrict, provide ';'-separated trees list, where UDF libraries
# are stored. Relative paths are treated relative to the root directory
# of Firebird.
#
# The default value is None. Set it to 'Restrict UDF' to have the same
# restriction as in Firebird 3 and earlier. To specify access to specific
# trees, enumerate all required paths (for Windows this may be something
# like 'C:\ExternalFunctions', for unix - '/db/udf;/mnt/udf').
#
# NOTE: THE EXTERNAL FUNCTION ENGINE FEATURE COULD BE USED TO COMPROMISE
# THE SERVER/HOST AS WELL AS DATABASE SECURITY!
#
# IT IS STRONGLY RECOMMENDED THAT THIS SETTING REMAINS NONE!
#
# Type: string (special format)
#
#UdfAccess = None


# ----------------------------
# Temporary directories
#
# Provide ';'-separated trees list, where temporary files are stored.
# Relative paths are treated relative to the root directory of Firebird.
# Default value is determined using FIREBIRD_TMP, TEMP or TMP
# environment options. Once the first specified directory has no
# available space, the engine will switch to the next one, and so on.
#
# E.g.:
# TempDirectories = c:\temp
# or
# TempDirectories = c:\temp;d:\temp
#
# Type: string (special format)
#
#TempDirectories =


# ----------------------------
# Directory to put data of temporary tables and blobs
#
# When empty, not exists or not accessible, the default directory will be used
# as determined by FIREBIRD_TMP, TEMP or TMP environment variables.
#
# Per-database configurable.
#
# Type: string
#
#TempTableDirectory =


# ----------------------------
# Trace configuration file for system audit
#
# Empty value means that system audit is turned off.
#
# Type: string
#
#AuditTraceConfigFile =


# ----------------------------
# Maximum summary size of each user trace session's log files in MB.
# When log files size reach this limit, trace session automatically
# suspends until an interactive user service reads and deletes log files.
#
# Type: integer
#
#MaxUserTraceLogSize = 10


# ----------------------------
# Number of cached database pages
#
# The number of pages from any one database that can be held in cache
# at once. If you increase this value, the engine will allocate more
# pages to the cache for every database. By default, SuperServer
# allocates 2048 pages for each database and Classic and SuperClassic
# allocate 256 pages per client connection per database.
#
# Per-database configurable.
#
# Type: integer
#
#DefaultDbCachePages = 2048


# ----------------------------
# Disk space preallocation
#
# Sets the amount of preallocated disk space in bytes. Disk space
# preallocation reduces physical file fragmentation and can allow databases
# to work in out of disk space conditions. With preallocation enabled,
# the engine allocates 1/16nth of already allocated disk space at a time, but
# not less than 128KB and no more than DatabaseGrowthIncrement (128MB by
# default). To disable preallocation, set DatabaseGrowthIncrement to zero.
# Shadow database files are not preallocated.
#
# Per-database configurable.
#
# Type: integer
#
#DatabaseGrowthIncrement = 128M


# ----------------------------
# File system cache usage
#
# Determines if Firebird will use the file system cache for database files.
#
# Type: boolean
#
# Per-database configurable.
#
#UseFileSystemCache = true


# ----------------------------
# File system cache threshold
#
# The threshold value that determines if Firebird will use the file system
# cache. File system caching is used if database cache size in pages
# (configured explicitly in the database header or via DefaultDbCachePages setting)
# is less than the value of FileSystemCacheThreshold.
#
# To always use the file system cache, set FileSystemCacheThreshold to a large value.
# To bypass the file system cache for all databases, set FileSystemCacheThreshold to
# zero.
#
# CAUTION!
# This setting is deprecated and will be removed in future Firebird versions.
# Consider using UseFileSystemCache setting instead.
# If UseFileSystemCache is set, the value of FileSystemCacheThreshold is ignored.
# If UseFileSystemCache is not set, and FileSystemCacheThreshold is set, the value
# of FileSystemCacheThreshold is in use and accounted by the engine.
#
# Type: integer, measured in database pages
#
# Per-database configurable.
#
#FileSystemCacheThreshold = 64K


# ----------------------------
# File system cache size
#
# This setting controls the maximum amount of RAM used by Windows file system
# cache on a 64-bit Windows host. It has no effect for Unix hosts in this release yet.
#
# Note that the lowest number presently supported is 10%, and the highest number
# is 95%; numbers outside these limits will apply a default value of 30%.
#
# If the cache size has already been selected when the engine starts, the host
# setting will not be changed. Thus you may need to reboot the host for the
# change of this setting to have effect.
#
# To leave host caching settings unchanged, set this parameter to 0. This is
# the default parameter value.
#
# Security note
# To adjust the setting, the engine needs the SeIncreaseQuotaPrivilege right.
# Built-in service accounts and administrators have it by default. The installer
# grants this right to the Firebird service account. If the engine fails to adjust
# the cache size setting, it will log a warning message to the firebird.log and
# continue.
#
# Type: integer, measured in % of total physical RAM
#
#FileSystemCacheSize = 0


# ----------------------------
# Remove protection against opening databases on NFS mounted volumes on
# Linux/Unix and SMB/CIFS volumes on Windows.
#
# This also permits creating database shadows on mounted network volumes.
#
#     ***WARNING*** ***WARNING*** ***WARNING*** ***WARNING***
#
# This option removes an important safety feature of Firebird and can
# cause irrecoverable database corruption. Do not use this option unless
# you understand the risks and are prepared to accept the loss of the
# contents of your database.
# Unless this configuration option is changed from 0 to 1, Firebird can
# open a database only if the database is stored on a drive physically
# attached to the local computer - the computer running that copy of
# Firebird. Requests for connections to databases stored on NFS mounted
# drives are redirected to a Firebird server running on the computer that
# "owns" the disk.
# This restriction prevents two different copies of Firebird from opening
# the same database without coordinating their activities. Uncoordinated
# access by multiple copies of Firebird will corrupt a database. On a local
# system, the system-level file locking prevents uncoordinated access to
# the database file.
#
# NFS does not provide a reliable way to detect multiple users of a file on
# an NFS mounted disk. If a second copy of Firebird connects to a database on
# an NFS mounted disk, it will corrupt the database.
# Under some circumstances, running a Firebird server on the computer that
# owns NFS mounted volumes is inconvenient or impossible. Applications that
# use the "embedded" variant of Firebird and never share access to a database
# can use this option to permit direct access to databases on NFS mounted
# volumes.
#
# The situation for SMB/CIFS is quite similar to NFS with not all configurations
# providing file locking mechanisms needed for safe operation. Using SuperServer
# engine with the database on a Windows Server file server may be considered
# relatively safe as file locking protects the database from being used by
# several engines. The network stack can still change order of writes, so you
# may get a corrupted database in case of network errors or power outage.
#
# The useful and safe case is working with a shared database marked read-only.
#
# DO NOT ENABLE THIS OPTION UNLESS YOU REALLY KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING.
#
# Type: boolean
#
#RemoteFileOpenAbility = 0


# ============================
# Temporary space management
# ============================

# ----------------------------
# Temporary storage is used by the sorting module, it's also
# intended to store temporary datasets etc.
#
# The parameters below handle the allocation and caching policy
# for the temporary space manager. In previous Firebird versions,
# they were prefixed with "SortMem" instead of current "Temp".
#
# The smallest block size being allocated in the temporary storage.
# This value reflects the allocation granularity.
#
# Type: integer
#
#TempBlockSize = 1M

# ----------------------------
# The maximum amount of the temporary space that can be cached
# in memory.
#
# For Classic servers, this setting is defaulted to 8 MB.
# Although it can be increased, the value applies to each client
# connection/server instance and thus consumes a lot of memory.
#
# Per-database configurable.
#
# Type: integer
#
#TempCacheLimit = 64M


# ----------------------------
# Maximum allowed identifier name length in bytes
#
# Sets a limit for the number of bytes in an identifier.
#
# Set to 31 to limit as Firebird 3.0 and previous versions. Setting
# this value for all databases (including the security database) may
# cause problems.
#
# Per-database configurable.
#
# Type: integer
#
#MaxIdentifierByteLength = 252


# ----------------------------
# Maximum allowed identifier name length in characters
#
# Sets a limit for the number of characters in an identifier.
#
# Setting this value for all databases (including the security database)
# may cause problems.
#
# Per-database configurable.
#
# Type: integer
#
#MaxIdentifierCharLength = 63


# ----------------------------
# Threshold that controls whether to store non-key fields in the sort block or
# refetch them from data pages after sorting.
#
# Defines the maximum sort record size (in bytes) that can be stored inline,
# i.e. in the sort block. Zero means that records are always refetched.
#
# Per-database configurable.
#
# Type: integer
#
#InlineSortThreshold = 1000


# ----------------------------
# Defines whether queries should be optimized to retrieve the first records
# as soon as possible rather than returning the whole dataset as soon as possible.
# By default retrieval of all rows is implied by the optimizer.
#
# Can be overridden at the session level using the SET OPTIMIZE statement
# or at the SQL statement level by using the OPTIMIZE FOR clause.
#
# Per-database configurable.
#
# Type: boolean
#
#OptimizeForFirstRows = false


# ----------------------------
# Defines whether OUTER joins are attempted to be converted into INNER joins,
# provided that such a transformation is possible from the query result perspective.
#
# Enabled by default. Disable to simplify the migration path if OUTER joins
# are used intentionally in SQL queries (e.g. as optimizer hints) even if
# they are known to be semantically equivalent to INNER joins.

# CAUTION!
# There is no guarantee that this setting will be available in future Firebird
# versions.
#
# Per-database configurable.
#
# Type: boolean

# ============================
# Plugin settings
# ============================
#
# This group of parameters determines what plugins will be used by Firebird.
# Format of string is the list of plugins, separated by space, ',' or ';'.
# Plugins will be tried in an order, specified here.
# In many cases correct order is important!
#
# Type: string

# ----------------------------
# AuthServer and AuthClient determine which authentication methods will be used
# by network server and client redirector. The Secure Remote Password plugin
# using SHA-256 for the client proof is the default for both client and server.
# Additionally, the default client configuration (AuthClient) also supports old Srp
# plugin using SHA-1 for the client proof. This enables backwards compatibility
# with old Firebird 3.0 servers, but does not comply with NIST security requirements.
# Srp plugins using other SHA algorithms (SHA-224, SHA-384 & SHA-512) are also
# implemented and may be used (names are Srp224, Srp384 & Srp512 respectively).
#
# The default client configuration (AuthClient) also supports the pre-Firebird 3.0
# legacy authentication protocol (Legacy_Auth). This is again for backwards
# compatibility, but has many known weaknesses and is deprecated.
#
# The default Windows client configuration (AuthClient) also includes support for
# the Win_Sspi plugin. This implements windows trusted authentication and is backward
# compatible with 2.1 and 2.5 clients and servers running on Windows.
#
# Per-database configurable.
#
#AuthServer = Srp256

# Per-connection and per-database configurable.
#
#AuthClient = Srp256, Srp, Legacy_Auth           #Non Windows clients
#AuthClient = Srp256, Srp, Win_Sspi, Legacy_Auth #Windows clients

# If you need to use server plugins that do not provide encryption key (Legacy_Auth is the
# only such standard plugin) you should also turn off required encryption on the wire with WireCrypt
# configuration parameter except when working with the XNET protocol which is never encrypted.


# ----------------------------
# UserManager sets the plugins used to work with the security database. If more than
# one plugin is given, the first plugin from the list is used by default. If you
# need to manage legacy logins using legacy tools set it to Legacy_UserManager.
# Other managers may be chosen in create/alter/drop user commands.
#
# Per-database configurable.
#
#UserManager = Srp


# ----------------------------
# Default profiler plugin used to profile connections using the RDB$PROFILER package.
#
# Per-database configurable.
#
#DefaultProfilerPlugin = Default_Profiler


# ----------------------------
# TracePlugin is used by Firebird trace facility to send trace data to the user
# or log file in audit case.
#
#TracePlugin = fbtrace


# ----------------------------
# Wire crypt plugins are used to encrypt data transferred over the wire.
# By default, data is encrypted using ChaCha#20 (32/64 bit counter variants)
# or Alleged RC4. Key must be generated by auth plugin.
# For chacha we are using 16 or 32 bytes key (depends upon what is provided
# by auth plugin), 12 (8) bytes nonce and 4 (8) bytes counter, 20 (10 + 10)
# rounds are made.
#
# Per-connection configurable.
#
#WireCryptPlugin = ChaCha64, ChaCha, Arc4


# ----------------------------
# Key holder is a kind of temp storage for DB crypt keys.
# There is no default for this kind of plugins.
#
#KeyHolderPlugin =


# ----------------------------
# Ability to use encrypted security database
#
# If one relies on network encryption with the encryption key generated by
# the authentication plugin (like SRP does) to transfer database encryption
# keys over the wire, use of encrypted security databases is a kind of vicious
# circle. In order to send the DB encryption key over the wire in a secure way,
# wire transfers should be already encrypted, but this requires a wire encryption
# key from the authentication plugin, which needs to open the security database
# for hash validation which in turn requires the DB encryption key. Luckily, in
# most cases there is no big need to encrypt security database - it protects
# itself quite well if you use high quality passwords. But in some cases, it is
# necessary to have the security database encrypted, for example if one wants to
# use the self security database feature for an encrypted database. In that case,
# special care should be taken to encrypt that key before passing it to server
# using a callback.
# Make sure your keys are well encrypted before enabling this parameter. Take into
# account that with AllowEncryptedSecurityDatabase=TRUE, unencrypted key transfer
# may take place even when the security database is not encrypted.
# This feature is not supported by legacy authentication plugin - if you care
# about security please never use legacy authentication.

# Relaxing relation alias checking rules in SQL
#
# Since Firebird 2.0, strict alias checking rules were implemented in the SQL

# the first processor, the value is 1. To use both CPU 1 and CPU 2,
# the value is 3. To use CPU 2 and CPU 3, the value is 6.
# The default value is 0 - no affinity will be set.
#
# About systems with heterogeneous (Efficient/Performance) set of cores:
# on Windows 10 and later, if affinity is not set nor by CpuAffinityMask,
# nor by the caller process, then the server tries to exclude efficient cores
# from its own affinity mask, i.e. default affinity mask includes performance
# cores only.

# Remove protection against redirecting requests to other servers

#     ***DEPRECATED*** ***DEPRECATED*** ***DEPRECATED***
#
# This feature was partially broken in Firebird 3 with early (in remote listener)
# user authentication. Not all plugins can be used with Redirection.
# No matter of that we did not receive related bug reports, i.e. it's unused.
# Therefore Redirection is declared DEPRECATED in Firebird 5 and will be removed
# in Firebird 6.
#
#     ***WARNING*** ***WARNING*** ***WARNING*** ***WARNING***
#
# Ability to redirect requests to other servers was initially present
# in Interbase, but was broken by Borland in Interbase 6.0, when
# they added SQL dialects. Request redirection was fixed in Firebird 2.0,
# but today such behaviour (proxy) seems to be dangerous from security
# point of view. Imagine, you have one carefully protected Firebird server,
# access to which is possible from global net. But in case when this server
# has access to your internal LAN (may and should be restricted,
# but often possible), it will work as a gateway for incoming requests like:
# firebird.your.domain.com:internal_server:/private/database.fdb
# It's enough to know name/IP of some internal server on your LAN, and for
# this connection, one even need not know login/password on external server.
# Such gateway easily overrides firewall, installed to protect your LAN
# from outside attack.
#
# DO NOT ENABLE THIS OPTION UNLESS YOU REALLY KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING.
